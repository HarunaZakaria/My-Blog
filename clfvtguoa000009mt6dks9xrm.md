## Introduction

If you are a newbie to programming and you have been hearing GitHub and donâ€™t know what exactly it is, then here is the right place for you to get to understand everything that you need to know and start using it yourself.

GitHub is something that you will probably be hearing when you are getting started with programming, however getting to know more about it will help you a lot in the long run.

But before we get into it there are two basic terms that you need to understand first, and these are version control and git.

### **version control**

The maintenance and management of source code changes in software projects are made easier by version control.

Version management becomes essential when a software project expands. Considering WordPress

WordPress is actually a huge project. Enabling a core developer to change the "official" source code, wouldn't be efficient or safe if they wanted to contribute to a specific area of the WordPress codebase.

Instead, branching and merging are safe production methods made possible by version control.

A developer replicates some of the source code using branching (called the repository).

the developer can make changes to the section of the code without compromising the project's performance.

After the developer completes his or her part of the code,

The developer can then integrate that code back into the primary source code to make it official after getting their particular part of the code to perform.

All these modifications are then tracked and can then be replaced if need be.

### **Git**

Linus Torvalds developed the open-source version control system known as Git in 2005.

To be more precise, Git is a distributed version control system, which implies that every developer's computer has access to the whole codebase and history, facilitating simple branching and merging.

More than 87% of developers use Git, according to a Stack Overflow developer study.

So these should be a good start to knowing GitHub, without wasting time let us get to the real business here.

## What is GitHub

A for-profit business called GitHub provides a service for hosting Git repositories in the cloud. It essentially simplifies the usage of Git for version management and collaboration by individuals and teams.

Because of GitHub's user-friendly design, even newbie programmers can benefit from Git. Without GitHub, utilizing Git typically necessitates a little more command-line experience and technical know-how.

But, because GitHub is so user-friendly, some individuals even use it to handle different kinds of projects, including writing books.

Also, anyone may join and host a public code repository on GitHub for no cost, which is why open-source projects are particularly fond of it.

GitHub earns money as a company through selling hosted private code repositories, as well as other business-focused services that make it easier for enterprises to manage team members and security.

Now that you know what GitHub basically is, we can move forward to how to get started with it continue reading this to get more insight into GitHub.

## How to get started with GitHub

To be able to push their source codes there for future use, Github offers opportunities for both individuals and companies to create an account with them. To learn more about this, click on this link ([source](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started)) to read the GitHub documentary.

This manual will teach you everything you need to get started with GitHub and will also instruct you on how to use it, a program that works in conjunction with GitHub

## How to create a repository

It's time to start working on your repository after successfully creating your Github account, but first, let's define a repository.

A repository in technology is a central location where data is kept and handled; it functions like a folder that will hold all the code files you are writing.

You must access your GitHub account in order to create a repository. On the left side of the page, you will see something similar to this.

To establish a new repository, you must click the new button; alternatively, you may also check the right side of your account.

You can select a new repository to have this page sent to you when you click the + symbol, which will open this menu for you.

So, choosing either the right or left side option will lead you to this specific page where you can give your repository a name.

Any name is acceptable, however, it is best to name it after the project you will be working on.

If you'd like, you can write a brief description of your repository; however, doing so is optional, and thus the choice to do so is entirely yours.

I suggested leaving your repository set to the public because you are just getting started so that others may view it and see what you are doing

Following that, simply click the "create repository" button and everything is done.

## How to delete a repository

Now that I've got your assurance, you can build repositories on your own, but there will come a moment when you'll need to delete a repository. You must follow these guidelines in order to be able to do that because it may be due to a variety of factors.

When you look at the top of the repository you want to delete, you will see the setting.

![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/HpA8yG3OQ2_ASm6DkP86ekEzLJ8n-taGAy8UYOqEPNDmti-191wguyv46T8xYXUv5JoPm4JSvAIwdQ8D0qoF0zXEUq1RAG3jkPE8P_BQzq9KWUd1Cs4IOkJR_tVhCnhG85QSFXvUzYHAiUiuHN5NOe8 align="left")

You then need to scroll down to the bottom of the new page that appears when you click the setting until you see a danger zone.

You then choose to delete a repository, and this will also take you to a different page.

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/1BgyjIQjsiMmB4bm0R3bsxA9FNrknZSVoit40j4v4Wze58b092Bnktpym3sRJyC3W0kS1FLCDdKHox5Sbigd9HBOuBhTilURiQ85qDOUrQ_NBZx7-ZmG1jEuLbKvWjcabWQKWSrdAZKEET50Bli-rt0 align="left")

The name of your repository must be entered exactly because if you omit even one letter, it will not work. Hence, I advise you to simply copy and paste the names.

When you're finished, click the button underneath it, enter your login information to verify that you really deleted it, and you're all set.

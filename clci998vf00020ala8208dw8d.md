Hi, everyone my name is Haruna Zakaria a software engineer and a content creator, I have been on this platform for a while now and today I decided to write my first blog post to make friends and meet like-minded people to gain more knowledge and experience as both a software engineer and a content creator.

Programming has always been my dream since childhood and I didn’t even know what it was at that time but my dream was to become a software engineer and whenever I watch a movie that involves tech I get more inspiration for software engineering, until last year that I was able to buy my laptop and started pursuing my dream.

As an individual who always wants to be a programmer, I did not know where to start as a beginner and I didn’t even know which programming language to start learning since I was new to everything so I tried learning different languages but I couldn’t finish most of them because initially, I thought it was going to be easy for me but it wasn’t.

In the beginning, my mind was to just go straight and learn software engineering, specifically a full stack developer but as I progressed from my journey I realized that there is a need for me to learn some basic stuff before going straight to software engineering.

So I started to learn content creation, it took me three full months to complete that course to become a content creator and after that, I got a few friends who were also passionate about learning tech and some of them were already in the tech field.

And through them I was able to get some guidance as to where to whereto start my software journey, I  learned HTML, CSS and javascript on my own and one of the people that I met in my content creation group was organizing a WordPress class for free so I decided to join and learn that one too.

It didn’t take me a while and I got a link to apply for the ALX SE program to continue my dream. In the beginning, it all seemed like a joke but as time passed it became more serious than I thought and I could sit on my laptop for half a day without getting up.

Although it was not easy it made me excited because it was my dream to become a software engineer, and I was in the process for the whole of 2022.

It was through that program that I got to know about this platform and I decided to join and meet different people of different backgrounds who are pursuing similar goals and are willing to help each other.

One of my goals for joining this platform is to write a blog post that will explain concepts and codes that seem difficult because I have realized that it is what every beginner programmer needs to be more efficient.

I also intend to connect to more people and contribute to projects and get internships to be able to practice the skills that I have learned so far in my programming journey, right now I can take the role of frontend developer so feel free to link me up with jobs or internships that you are aware of and if you want me to assist you in any way you can mail me at [Harunzy55@gmail.com](mailto:Harunzy55@gmail.com). My doors are always open.

I hope this post wasn’t a waste of your time.
